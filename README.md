# food-tracker
FoodTracker is a universal iOS app that Apple created for a tutorial called 'Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift): Jump Right In'. I made modifications to the code as I wrote the app from my point of view.

## Note
The master branch implements an unwind segue to pass data back, as Apple suggested in the tutorial; whereas, the delegate-pass-data-back branch uses a delegate that I wrote.
